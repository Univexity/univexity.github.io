        <h1>Important Update from Xyra Studios</h1>
        <p>Dear visitors,</p>
        <p>We want to inform you that we have officially closed our GitHub page.</p>
        <p>GitHub has been a platform where we shared projects, updates, and tools with our community. However, we have decided to move to a new, dedicated website to provide a better experience.</p>
        <p>All projects, updates, and reports will now be handled exclusively through our new website.</p>
        <p>This move allows us to offer a modern interface, interactive dashboards, and a faster, more secure way for users to interact with our services.</p>
        <p>The new platform also provides features that were not possible on GitHub, including a dedicated admin panel and public dashboards for easier access.</p>
        <p>For anyone who has followed us here, please note that all future updates and submissions will happen on the new site. GitHub will no longer be used for contributions or reports.</p>
        <p>We understand that change can be unexpected, but this transition is designed to improve the experience for our users and community.</p>
        <p>To access our new website and explore all updates, please visit: <a href="https://univexity-report-hub.base44.app/Home" target="_blank">https://univexity-report-hub.base44.app/Home</a></p>
        <p>We appreciate your understanding and support. We are excited to continue building and improving our platform with you.</p>
        <p>Thank you for being part of our journey, and we hope to see you on our new website soon!</p>
        <p>Best regards,<br>Xyra Studios</p>
