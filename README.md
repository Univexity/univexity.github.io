# 📢 Important Update from Xyra Studios

## Notice: GitHub Closure & Platform Updates

Dear visitors and community members,  

We would like to inform you that Xyra Studios has officially closed its GitHub page. This means that we will no longer be maintaining projects, boards, or updates on GitHub.  

GitHub has been a valuable platform where we shared projects, updates, and tools with our community. However, we have decided to migrate all services to a dedicated, modern platform to improve user experience.  

Our new platform allows us to provide a more secure, streamlined, and interactive environment for all users.  

All ongoing projects, submissions, and reports will now be exclusively hosted on our new website.  

We encourage all visitors to bookmark and access our new website regularly to stay updated with the latest features and announcements.  

The new platform supports a modern interface, faster updates, and enhanced security for all users.  

Additionally, the new website provides features that were not possible on GitHub, including a dedicated admin panel and interactive public dashboards.  

For contributors who followed our GitHub repositories, please note that we will no longer accept contributions, forks, or issues here.  

This decision ensures that we can maintain a consistent experience across all services while focusing on the growth and functionality of our new platform.

## Public Board Shutdown

The Public Board has officially been shut down and is no longer maintained on GitHub.  

All reports, updates, and interactions previously handled through this board have been migrated to our new website.  

The new platform allows for a faster, more secure, and user-friendly experience when submitting or tracking reports.  

If you are a user from the new website or require assistance, please contact our support team via Discord: [https://discord.gg/2SFx9fGGEw](https://discord.gg/2SFx9fGGEw).  

This migration ensures that all public interactions are streamlined and centrally managed.

The Public Board shutdown allows us to consolidate all services in one modern and secure location.

## New Website & Platform Information

All services have moved to our new website: [https://univexity-report-hub.base44.app/Home](https://univexity-report-hub.base44.app/Home).  

This platform offers a secure reporting system, interactive dashboards, and an admin panel to manage submissions efficiently.  

We designed the new website to provide users with a seamless and intuitive experience.  

Features include fast updates, better support channels, and the ability to interact with our team directly.  

All content, including reports and project updates, are now available exclusively on this platform.  

The website also includes public dashboards, making it easier for users to monitor project status and submissions.  

We strongly encourage all users to transition to the new platform for all future updates.

## Why We Made These Changes

GitHub was a valuable platform, but it had limitations for the services we wanted to offer.  

By moving to a dedicated website, we can provide more features, faster updates, and a better experience overall.  

Centralizing all services allows us to improve security, usability, and accessibility for all users.  

These changes also make it easier for us to manage support requests and maintain a professional standard across the platform.  

We appreciate the support and engagement from our community, and we want to make sure all users have access to the best possible tools.  

The new platform ensures that reports, boards, and project updates are all in one place.  

This transition is part of our ongoing effort to modernize our services and provide a more enjoyable experience for users.
